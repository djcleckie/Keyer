Opening file is.

file K3NG.ino

Next there is the 

keyer_hardware.h

This lists all the possible hardware types but all are initially commented out.

e.g.
// #define HARDWARE_NANOKEYER_REV_D 
or 
// #define HARDWARE_K5BCQ

For a specific hardware setup ONLY one of these should be uncommented. 

if one of these is un-commented then it gets #included by the big #if in the K3NG.ino file and the #else is never reached.
there are (at least 2 x #if)

has a long list of various hardware configurations
starting with 

#if defined(HARDWARE_OPENCWKEYER_MK2)
  #include "keyer_pin_settings_opencwkeyer_mk2.h"
  #include "keyer_settings_opencwkeyer_mk2.h"

#elif defined(HARDWARE_NANOKEYER_REV_D)
  #include "keyer_pin_settings_nanokeyer_rev_d.h"
  #include "keyer_settings_nanokeyer_rev_d.h"

#elif defined(HARDWARE_K5BCQ)
  #include "keyer_pin_settings_k5bcq.h"
  #include "keyer_settings_k5bcq.h"

Default if none are defined is at the end of the #if

#else
  #include "keyer_pin_settings.h"
  #include "keyer_settings.h"
#endif


Then there is another big #if statement which #includes the specific keyer_features_and_options
e.g.
#elif defined(HARDWARE_NANOKEYER_REV_D)
  #include "keyer_features_and_options_nanokeyer_rev_d.h"
or
#elif defined(HARDWARE_K5BCQ)
  #include "keyer_features_and_options_k5bcq.h"

//file keyer_features_and_options_k5bcq.h
//down at line 26 #define FEATURE_LCD_4BIT
//down at line 29 // #define FEATURE_LCD_ADAFRUIT_I2C is commented out

but 
keyer_features_and_options_nanokeyer_rev_d.h
has all LCD options commented out.


File types

K3NG.ino
keyer.h 
keyer_callsign_prefixes.h
keyer_debug.h
keyer_dependencies.h
keyer_features_and_options.h  (multiple versions for individual hardware)
keyer_hardware.h
keyer_pin_settings.h (multiple versions for individual hardware)
keyer_settings.h (multiple versions for individual hardware)
keyer_stm32duino.h
keyer_training_text_english.h (other language versions)



my default setup

keyer_hardware.h
all additional harware commented out.

Therefore it will use

keyer_features_and_options.h

in above the lines below are uncommented 

#define FEATURE_BUTTONS
#define FEATURE_COMMAND_MODE
#define FEATURE_COMMAND_LINE_INTERFACE // Command Line Interface functionality
#define FEATURE_SERIAL_HELP
